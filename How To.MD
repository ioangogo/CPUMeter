This assumes you know basic electronics and how to use arduino, if you dont the arduino site is a good place to start and i suggest doing the things on their site

#what you will need
* a 5v volt meter [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Direct-Current-White-Voltmeter-Analog/dp/B0051E8ONA/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1477140570&sr=8-11&keywords=5v+dc+voltmeter)
*Diode 
* a Arduino
* what ever you want to use to connect it to

##Step One
Follow the Diagram bellow for wiring with the Solinoid Being the meter. Use the 5v arudino rail to test what polarity the meter pins are.

##Step Two

Use the Code in this repo to get It to work, due to my constant fiddling with the code with out testing you may need to fiddle with the code. Running the PC thing you will need to type

``` sudo python CPULinux.py```

or

``` sudo python3 CPULinux.py```

And follow the onscreen instructions
